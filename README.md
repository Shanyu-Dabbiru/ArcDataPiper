# 🚀 Arc Data Piper

**Arc Data Piper** is an autonomous, anti-fragile data infrastructure layer that replaces legacy "Subscription SaaS" with a **Pay-as-you-Heal** economic model. 

By leveraging **Circle Nanopayments** on the **Arc Blockchain**, Arc Data Piper ensures that financial settlement is directly tied to system integrity. You only pay for observability when your stream is healthy, and you only pay for repairs when outcome-based patches are verified.

## 💎 The Nanopayment Thesis

In traditional data infrastructure, you pay for "availability," yet you are billed even when data is broken or silent. Arc Data Piper flips the incentive: **The payment is the validation signal.**

### 1. The $0.0001 Pulse (Health Signal)
The Observer Agent validates your data stream every 10 seconds. 
*   **Green Signal:** If the data matches the schema, a **$0.0001 USDC** nanopayment is released.
*   **The Stop-Loss:** If schema drift is detected, the Observer immediately ceases validation. **The financial meter stops instantly.** You never pay for broken monitoring.

### 2. The $0.001 Fixer Fee & $0.005 Bounty (Outcome Signal)
Recovery is handled by the Fixer Agent, hired only when needed via **x402 (HTTP 402)**.
*   **Hire Fee ($0.001):** A one-time micro-payment to trigger log analysis and patch generation.
*   **Success Bounty ($0.005):** Escrow-gated. Released only after **Google Gemini** verifies the patch in a sandbox environment.
*   **Recovery:** Once verified, the heartbeat resumes, and the $0.0001 pulse starts again.
